## Integrating a component library gem into a Rails app

An example Rails app demonstrating how a library of ViewComponents packaged as a Rails Engine gem (https://github.com/allmarkedup/example-component-library-gem) can be bundled into a host application and used in views.

### Get started

- `bundle install`
- `rails s`

This will start the app running at http://localhost:3000
